# learning_git

Random repo created to learn git

Learning **_git_** the proper way.

Use `fetch` command to track changes and `status` command to show changes

Learning `fetch` and `merge` now.

The `pull` command is a combo of the `fetch` and `merge` commands.

Learning the `push` command.

Learning about branches and using the `checkout` command to switch branches.

This commmit should happen in the `test` branch hopefully.

That was successfull.

This line should only be on the _local_ branch.
